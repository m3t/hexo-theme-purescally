### Stylesheets

Be guided by these [CSS authoring guidelines](https://github.com/chris-pearce/css-guidelines/).

#### `main.scss`

- **Be selective**

  Only import what is needed, so your CSS is as lean as possible.
  The Core section is however mandatory
  
- **Open for extension / Closed for modification**

  Any custom styles should not be added or modified in Scally directly.
  This also allows the framework to be updated seamlessly.
